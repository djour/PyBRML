There are a large number of demos that a lecturer may wish to use or adapt to help illustrate\r\nthe material. In addition many of the exercises make use of the code, helping the reader gain confidence\r\nin the concepts and their application. Along with complete routines for many Machine Learning methods,\r\nthe philosophy is to provide low level routines whose composition intuitively follows the mathematical description\r\nof the algorithm. In this way students may easily match the mathematics with the corresponding\r\nalgorithmic implementation.\r\n\r\nSOCIS 2013 Proposal\r\n======\r\nFramework construction and application to real-world inference problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n-------\r\n\r\nFormer MATLAB implementation of BRML Toolbox include:\r\n\r\n * Object Oriented Version (OO)\r\n * Older (non-OO)\r\n\r\n Check these two version from Dr. David Barber's Homepage:\r\n \r\n http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Software\r\n\r\nContribution\r\n-------\r\nThe source code is hosted on GitHub and comments, suggestions and contributions are welcomed.\r\nIf you use BRML toolbox in your work, please cite the reference book.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nThe Python version of BRML toolbox library is available under a GNU license.\r\n\r\nBundled dependencies\r\n-------\r\n * Numpy\r\n * matplotlib\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------\r\nUnder construction\r\n\r\nCommunity\r\n-------\r\nUnder construction\r\n\r\nReference\r\n-------\r\n\t@BOOK{barberBRML2012,\r\n\tauthor = {Barber, D.},\r\n\ttitle= {{Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning}},\r\n\tpublisher = {{Cambridge University Press}},\r\n\tyear = 2012}\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
